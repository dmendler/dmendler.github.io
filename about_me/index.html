    <h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
    <p>
      I am a Junior pursuing a Computer Science degree within the College of
      Engineering. I am also working towards a minor in Engineering Corporate
      Practice. Outside of the classroom, I am member of the Junior Class
      Council and a member of the Notre Dame Rugby team. I also co-founded the
      Robinson Center Chess Instruction Club, where we help young kids at the
      Robinson Learning Center learn how to play the game of chess. I am also an
      Eagle Scout, participating in the boy scout program for seven years. I am
      originally from Wayne, Pennsylvania, which is a suburb of Philadelphia.
      Before Notre Dame, I attended Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern,
      Pennsylvania.
